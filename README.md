# DeepPi

Reasonix-style DeepSeek price/performance for the Pi coding agent.

DeepPi targets the direct DeepSeek API only. It stabilizes cacheable request
prefixes, reports measured cache economics from Pi's real usage records, and
reduces paid retries with loop guards and hash-verified edits.

## Supported models

- `deepseek-v4-flash`
- `deepseek-v4-pro`

DeepPi is dormant for every other provider and model.

## Install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/christopherarter/deep-pi
```

Reload Pi, select a supported direct DeepSeek model, and run `/deeppi`.

## What `/deeppi` measures

- cache-read and uncached input tokens;
- cache-hit rate;
- actual input cost from Pi;
- estimated savings against fully uncached input;
- detected local prefix churn;
- guarded retry loops and hashline edit outcomes.

DeepPi does not promise a fixed hit rate. Provider cache expiry and backend
state can produce misses even when the local request prefix is stable.

## Development

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm run verify
```

Default verification never calls an external API. The paid smoke benchmark is
explicitly opt-in:

```bash
DEEPPI_LIVE=1 npm run benchmark:live
```
